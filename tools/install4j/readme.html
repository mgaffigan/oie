  <p>Open Integration Engine 4.5.2</p>
  <p>
    This installer sets up a fully functional version of the engine with minimal user input.
    The installer requires administrator permissions to run and install services.
  </p>
  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Native services are installed for all supported platforms and are configured to start automatically.</li>
  <li><strong>macOS users:</strong> A reboot will automatically start the service.</li>
    <li>
      Default settings from mirth.properties are applied automatically; the installer does not prompt for customization.
    </li>
    <li>This includes ports (default: 8080 and 8443), log and app data paths, and password requirements.</li>
    <li>
      Previous installations are not preserved, though runtime-created directories 
      (e.g., appdata) 
      are retained across installs.
    </li>
