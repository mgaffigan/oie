# Add any custom vmoptions to this file. Special directives are:
#
# -include-options <path to file>
#     : include options from another .vmoptions file. Applied recursively. Relative paths
#     : are relative to the current vmoptions file.
#
# -classpath <path>
#     : replace the classpath built so far with <path>
#
# -classpath/p <path>
#     : prepend <path> to classpath.
#
# -classpath/a <path>
#     : append <path> to classpath.
#
# -java-cmd <path to java command>
#     : use the java binary specified to launch the engine. Relative paths are relative to
#     : the engine home directory.
#
# Additionally, the form ${ENV_VAR} can be used anywhere in the file to substitute the value
# from an environment variable.
#
# Any lines which do not match the special directives above will be passed through directly as
# arguments to the java binary.
